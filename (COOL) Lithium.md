# (COOL) Lithium ⚡ License – Full Manifesto Edition

Copyright (c) 2025 Plexescor

Welcome, traveler. By opening **ViraChrono**, you have entered a sacred space. A place where focus meets precision, where code meets chaos, and where your digital life is laid bare for **scientific observation and creative mastery**.

This is not just software. This is a **movement**. A tool for the curious, the obsessed, the hacker-minded, and those who refuse to settle for mediocrity.

---

## The Rules of Engagement 🚀

By touching this code, you swear to uphold the following creed:

* You may **look at it**, study it, and dissect it. Examine every byte, every line, every function with the hunger of a coder possessed.
* You may **modify it**, break it, twist it, and remake it into whatever the fuck you want. Nothing is sacred here. Bend it to your will.
* You may **share it**, broadcast your discoveries, and flex your hacks to the world like a digital gladiator.
* You may **experiment**, push it past its limits, make it dance, crash, or explode—but always **learn from it**.
* **Do whatever the fuck you wannna do with this.** Seriously. No rules beyond respect for your own system.

---

## But Remember ⚠️

Even rebels have wisdom, and even the wildest hackers must heed these words:

* ViraChrono is **fully offline**. Your data never leaves your machine. No cloud. No telemetry. No spies. Not a single keystroke escapes. Your privacy is sacred.
* This software comes **as-is**. If your computer melts, your cat walks across your keyboard, your coffee spills, or your energy drinks fail to fuel your brilliance… that is **entirely on you**.
* ViraChrono is powerful, but it is **merely a mirror**. It will show you where your focus is spent, but it cannot make you productive. That part… is all you.

## The Philosophy of ViraChrono 💡

Why does ViraChrono exist?

Because most productivity tools lie. They pretend to help you, but behind the flashy charts and cloud sync, they are **time thieves**.

ViraChrono is different:

* **Raw.** No fluff, no bells, no whistles.
* **Private.** All data stays on your machine. Always.
* **Precise.** Every window switch, every focus streak, every millisecond counts.
* **Silent.** Runs in the background, sipping minimal CPU and memory, like a shadow that watches but never judges.

It doesn’t tell you what to do. It doesn’t nag, it doesn’t guilt-trip. It **reveals the truth of your digital habits**, and lets you decide what to do with that truth.

## For the Devs Who Dare 💻

If you are reading this, you are likely a coder, a tinkerer, a performance freak. You know the difference between **pure C++ efficiency** and bloated frameworks. You appreciate:

* **Win32 API precision** – hooks that know exactly which window is active.
* **SDL2 GUI foundation** – lightweight, fast, ready for visualizations.
* **Minimalism** – nothing extra, nothing unnecessary, nothing that wastes CPU cycles or RAM.

ViraChrono respects your intelligence, your privacy, and your time.

---

## The Future (Tease) 🌟

Even though this version is barebones, the **promise of evolution** lies ahead:

* Interactive charts and heatmaps that reveal hidden patterns.
* Offline PDF reports that let you show your focus stats like a badge of honor.
* Linux support, because freedom matters.
* Event pattern detection that will make you wonder how distracted you really are.

But for now… the **core power is in your hands**. The silent tracking. The switch counting. The unfiltered truth.

---

## Closing Words 🛡️

ViraChrono is more than code. It is a **manifesto**. A statement. A rebellion against the mediocre, the bloated, the data-hungry software that surrounds us.

* Learn from it.
* Break it.
* Rewrite it.
* Flex it.
* Do whatever the fuck you wannna do with this.

But never forget: the **power and responsibility** are yours alone. Respect your machine. Respect your focus. Respect yourself.
